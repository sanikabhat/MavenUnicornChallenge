Analysis of Private companies with over $1B valuation. Used Tablea Prep, Microsoft Excel and Tableau Desktop

Decided to brush up my tableau skills after last semester and took up this @maven analytics challenge
Used the following analysis/visualization tools:
Tableau Prep: Data cleaning
Tableau Desktop: Data visualizations and dashboard
Microsoft Excel: Data Analysis

The task was to analyse private companies with a valuation of over $1B (they are called unicorns here).
Analysed the global trend of these unicorns and found out quiet a few interesting things. 
The data had some columns that needed to be in proper format. For example - Funding and valuation were in string format and needed to be converted to integer format. 

Used calculated fields, table calculations, analysis average lines, a lot of different charts, etc.

Had a lot of fun taking part in this challenge because you are exposed to different perspectives and learn a lot of new things.
